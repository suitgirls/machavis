            My postis about Agnes Meyer Driscoll and her role as a cryptanalyst, what kind or work she did, 
            Her accomplistmemts, where she worked, and When did her work take place.

            Agnes was a navy cryptanalyst who helped solve hidden messages in Japanese naval systems during various wars. 
            She entered into the U.S navy in 1918 and was assigned the rank of Chief Yeoman of the Code and Signal section of the 
            Director of Naval Communications. Within her first days of working in the section she co-developed the "CM" but in 1923 she left the Navy 
            and Joined the fledgling Heben Electric Code company as a technical advisor. 
            However she later returned to the navy because the company failed later down the road.

            In her three-year career she broke Japanese navy codes such as: The Red Book Code (1920), 
            The Blue Book code and she even helped us break the codes for the Japanese fleetâ€™s operational code which the Navy exploited 
            after the Pearl Harbor attack. During that time she sponsored  the introduction to support cryptanalysis against Japanese naval code systems. 
            Early in WW2 she helped the navy fight against the German naval Enigma machine. 
            Agnes was a part of the navy contingent that joined cryptologic agencies with the Armed Forces Security Agency and National Security Agency.
