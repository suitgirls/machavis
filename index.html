        <h1> About Me! - Marrae Chavis</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, My name is Marrae Chavis-Thomas and I live in Cleveland, Ohio. I'm 17 and I'm going to be a Junior in the fall.
          My dream job is Game Development and if that fails then I would like to do Graphic Design. I listen to almost anything, and my Music tastes are 
          all over the place right now. I will listen to anything from Heavy metal to K-Pop.
          Though I was born on Ohio I moved to Georgia when my 2nd younger sister was born. We lived there for a while until my youngest sister was born.
          The only times I have even been out of state where when I moved to Georgia and when I joined this program.
