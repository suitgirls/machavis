    <title>Marrae Chavis-Thomas's Bio</title>
 </head>

 <body>
 Hello, My name is Marrae Chavis-Thomas and I live in Cleveland, Ohio. I'm 17 and I'm going to be a Junior in the fall. I decided to take this class because I was interested in Learning more about technology and hope to get a job in the computer science field in the future. I have 3 younger sisters and I like to listen to music. My music tastes are all over the place though, I also like rainy weather because it feels calming to me. I like Marvel movies and I've also watched Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and The Twilight Saga movies. I don't really have a favorite book right now but I would like to get back into reading. I would also like to get into crochet and maybe even learn to paint.
